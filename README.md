nodejs socketIO plugin system


It's too much of a pain to write a full documentation for this.
Basically the idea is to have a plugin system for nodeJS using socketIO

Normally you will have to write code on both client and server for an application to work (socket.emit and socket.on)

This system uses a dirty trick to dynamically generate code from the server and make client import it as legit javascript code.

Therefor, with one import statement from server, both client and server have what they need to be up and running...

I wrote a very sketchy jquery plugin that allows u to write jquery code from server...
Most of the code is not finalized, just a basic working prototype to illustrate the idea

That would be a sample if you want to contribute a plugin :)

I'm glad to hear from anyone who's interested
